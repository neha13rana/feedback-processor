# Pulpy-Juices
Pulpy-Juices is a web application developed with the *Django framework. Its primary purpose is twofold: to **gather feedback* from real customers about the various products, and to present the juice company manager with an *analysis of the feedback* received from all clients. The analysis is displayed in various graphs to aid comprehension.
